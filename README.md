This is my answer to the Hivery coding challenge

The project can be found at [Project](https://rocking42.github.io/hiveryChallenge/dist)

to load this on your system
```
1) git clone <project>
2) cd <project>
2) npm i
4) to start the project npm run start which will load webpack-dev-server
```
I've tried to go for a simple modular codebase approach to allow it to have the potential to scale from the start. Testing is set up but only at the basic unit level that can be ran with npm t which uses the Jest testing framework. Testing is something I want to learn so much more in and only want to push it further from here.

Thanks for the great challenge!
