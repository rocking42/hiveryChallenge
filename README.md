This is my answer to the Hivery coding challenge

to load this on your system
```
1) git clone <project>
2) cd <project>
2) npm i
4) to start the project npm run start which will load webpack-dev-server
```
I've tried to go for a simple modular codebase approach to allow it to have the potential to scale from the start. Testing is set up but not implemented yet however to run the test suite run npm t and it will go through all tests in the __test__ folder.

Good luck!
